# charging_station_opt
Code for the charging station optimal policy

This folder contains code to optimally schedule EV charging at the charging station in both "charging only" and V2G cases.

In the V2G case, two subcases are distinguished: when the problem of the whole day is solved globally ("global"), and when it is done in two phases ("before departure" then "after arrival").
